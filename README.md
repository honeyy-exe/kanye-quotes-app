# 🧠 Kanye Quotes App 🎤✨

Hellooo! So this is my ✨**Kanye Quotes App**✨ — it's basically a small desktop app I made using `Python` and `Tkinter` (yes, that boring looking GUI thing 😩). BUT I made it fun by connecting it to this super cool **Kanye REST API**, so every time you click the button, you get a random Kanye quote.

Like... literally. The man just *says stuff*. And this app delivers it like he's texting you himself 😂

## 👀 What it does (aka why I even made this lol)

- Opens a cute little window with a Kanye background 👑
- There's a button with his face on it 😭
- You click it 👉 and boom 💥 — you get a fresh quote
- It's funny. It's random. It's Kanye. Enough said.

## 💻 Tech used (don’t scroll away this is not that scary)

- `Python` 🐍
- `Tkinter` for GUI (a basic one but she works ok)
- `requests` module to fetch the quote from internet
- `Kanye REST API` (which is literally a free API that just spits Kanye's quotes, I love it)
